Mustering the audacity to talk with people who don’t know me often simply comes down to balancing the fear I have of embarrassment against the fear of failure and its repercussions. For my father, either he asked or his family didn’t have. For me, either I ask or I’m not successful. That fear always overrides my anxiety about rejection or being embarrassed.

He observes that “we perceive the world of objects as essentially separate from the world of minds, making it possible for us to envision soulless bodies and bodiless souls.” The two modes of causation that we are set to perceive make it natural for us to accept the two central beliefs of many religions: an immaterial divinity is the ultimate cause of the physical world, and immortal souls temporarily control our bodies while we live and leave them behind as we die.

Hindsight bias has pernicious effects on the evaluations of decision makers. It leads observers to assess the quality of a decision not by whether the process was sound but by whether its outcome was good or bad. Consider a low-risk surgical intervention in which an unpredictable accident occurred that caused the patient’s death. The jury will be prone to believe, after the fact, that the operation was actually risky and that the doctor who ordered it should have known better.

Imagine a company that has already spent $50 million on a project. The project is now behind schedule and the forecasts of its ultimate returns are less favorable than at the initial planning stage. An additional investment of $60 million is required to give the project a chance. An alternative proposal is to invest the same amount in a new project that currently looks likely to bring higher returns. What will the company do? All too often a company afflicted by sunk costs drives into the blizzard, throwing good money after bad rather than accepting the humiliation of closing the account of a costly failure. This situation is in the top-right cell of the fourfold pattern, where the choice is between a sure loss and an unfavorable gamble, which is often unwisely preferred.

More important, major innovations such as Lee’s stocking frame machine also threaten to reshape political power. Ultimately it was not concern about the fate of those who might become unemployed as a result of Lee’s machine that led Elizabeth I and James I to oppose his patent; it was their fear that they would become political losers—their concern that those displaced by the invention would create political instability

Extractive political institutions support these economic institutions by cementing the power of those who benefit from the extraction. Extractive economic and political institutions, though their details vary under different circumstances, are always at the root of this failure.

I wish I could tell you that through the tragedy I mined some undiscovered, life-altering absolute that I could pass on to you. I didn't. The clich+!s apply ' people are what count, life is precious, materialism is overrated, the little things matter, live in the moment ' and I can repeat them to you ad nauseam. You might listen, but you won't internalize. Tragedy hammers it home. Tragedy etches it onto your soul. You might not be happier. But you will be better. What makes this all the more ironic is that I've often wished that Elizabeth could see me now. Much as I'd like to, I don't believe the dead watch over us or any similar comfort-fantasy we sell ourselves. I believe the dead are gone for good. But I can't help but think: Perhaps now I am worthy of her. A more religious man might wonder if that is why she's returned. Rebecca Schayes was a leading freelance photographer.

With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing. The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them. Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions. The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.

The effects begin in the frontal lobes, the part of our brain behind our forehead that governs attention, motivation, planning, and learning. The first drink “dampens” activity in that region. It makes us a little dumber, less capable of handling competing complicated considerations. It hits the reward centers of the brain, the areas that govern euphoria, and gives them a little jolt. It finds its way into the amygdala. The amygdala’s job is to tell us how to react to the world around us. Are we being threatened? Should we be afraid? Alcohol turns the amygdala down a notch. The combination of those three effects is where myopia comes from.

Alcohol hits the hippocampus—small, sausage-like regions on each side of the brain that are responsible for forming memories about our lives. At a blood-alcohol level of roughly 0.08—the legal level of intoxication—the hippocampus starts to struggle.

The lesson of myopia is really very simple. If you want people to be themselves in a social encounter with a stranger—to represent their own desires honestly and clearly—they cannot be blind drunk. And if they are blind drunk, and therefore at the mercy of their environment, the worst possible place to be is an environment where men and women are grinding on the dance floor and jumping on the tables. A Kappa Alpha fraternity party is not a Camban drinking

We could start by no longer penalizing one another for defaulting to truth. If you are a parent whose child was abused by a stranger—even if you were in the room—that does not make you a bad parent. And if you are a university president and you do not jump to the worst-case scenario when given a murky report about one of your employees, that doesn’t make you a criminal. To assume the best about another is the trait that has created modern society. Those occasions when our trusting nature gets violated are tragic. But the alternative—to abandon trust as a defense against predation and deception—is worse.

“Do you know what the worst thing about being a parent is? That you’re always judged by your worst moments. You can do a million things right, but if you do one single thing wrong you’re forever that parent who was checking his phone in the park when your child was hit in the head by a swing. We don’t take our eyes off them for days at a time, but then you read just one text message and it’s as if all your best moments never happened. No one goes to see a psychologist to talk about all the times they weren’t hit in the head by a swing as a child. Parents are defined by their mistakes.”

there could be an open window in a closet. The bank robber was standing in the center of the apartment, surrounded by Stockholmers, both figurative and literal. “Stockholm” is, after all, an expression more than it is a place, both for men like Roger and for most of the rest of us, just a symbolic word to denote all the irritating people who get in the way of our happiness. People who think they’re better than us. Bankers who say no when we apply for a loan, psychologists who ask questions when we only want sleeping pills, old men who steal the apartments we want to renovate, rabbits who steal our wives. Everyone who doesn’t see us, doesn’t understand us, doesn’t care about us. Everyone has Stockholmers in their life, even people from Stockholm have their own Stockholmers, only to them it’s “people who live in New York” or “politicians in Brussels,” or other people from some other place where people seem to think that they’re better than the Stockholmers think they are. Everyone inside the apartment had their own complexes, their own demons and anxieties: Roger was wounded, Anna-Lena wanted to go home, Lennart couldn’t get his rabbit head off, Julia was tired, Ro was worried, Zara was in pain, and Estelle… well… no one really knew what Estelle was yet.

But keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear that what you’ve made can be taken away from you just as fast. It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you’ve made is attributable to luck, so past success can’t be relied upon to repeat indefinitely.

According to the decolonial school, the celebration of the Age of Discovery by proponents of Europeanism, that is, European supremacism, is understandable because the period was preceded by the Dark Ages for a millennium for Europe. However, since the rest of the world did not live in the Dark Ages prior to the fifteenth century, the celebration of the Age of Discovery by several erstwhile colonised societies is truly tragic and naïve.

In fact, the early introduction of colonial education systems in colonised societies and the replacement of indigenous epistemologies and their structures ensured that coloniality informed their present, shaped their ideas of the future and, critically, coloured their vision of the past.2 Depending on the inherent vitality and resilience of colonised cultures, the extent of internalisation of coloniality in the consciousness of dominated societies became truly evident when even their quests for political independence from the coloniser were based on the very framework introduced by him.

era of colonialism was over, its place was occupied by an even more worthy successor—Western imperialism—which inherited and expanded the legacy of coloniality. As scholars have pointed out, Western imperialism has proved to be a much more effective derivative of colonialism since it extended the territorial reach and depth of coloniality. Not only is the relationship of Western imperialism with other cultures the same as that of colonialism, namely ‘colonisation of the imagination of the dominated’, it has proved to be vastly more successful than colonialism in creating well-networked global power structures and totalising sub-frameworks that have sustained and advanced coloniality.

This the European coloniser passed off as his benevolence for he was saving the heathen native’s soul from the latter’s own ignorance, superstition and savagery. Had it not been for archaeological and ethnological studies, it would have been next to impossible to reconstruct native life as it existed in precolonial times or the genocides perpetrated by the coloniser. But for this evidence, European coloniality would have successfully justified and explained the civilising effect of colonisation and convinced us all that its culture, religion and way of life were globalised through peaceful means.25

The European colonial project, which started with Columbus’ expedition in 1492, did indeed have a clear Christian inspiration that viewed nature as well as the non-Christian New World through its Cartesian dualist/humanist prism; and 2. This dualist approach gave birth to the European coloniser’s sense of superiority over the rest of nature, including non-Christian idolatrous and nature-worshipping indigenous peoples. It led to the reshaping of nature to suit the material goals of the European coloniser, thereby giving rise to modern notions of development, and his sense of anthropological superiority created a race consciousness that spawned the global imperial exercise to civilise the soulless heathen natives by replacing the entirety of their cultures with the European’s.

The only difference was that this time the political structure was helmed not by the European coloniser but by the colonialised native who was a new convert to constitutionalism, constitutional morality and ultimately Europeanism/Western-normativism. It is precisely for these reasons that constitutionalism and its coloniality warrant a closer look.

When European nation-states emerged following the Peace of Westphalia, they were still a part of Christian Europe, with the three Christian denominations vying for the status of the true religion. Therefore, notwithstanding the internal fissures, conversations and debates, they were united in their stated goal of the expansion of the boundaries of Christianity through conquest of the New World. In other words, Christian nation-states were acutely alive to the religious-territorial canvas they were located within, which means that their nation-statehood was Christian in nature with a clear focus on demarcating their respective territories within Christian Europe

While the monasticised Roman Catholic Church served the true God, the true religion and Christ, and advanced the process of conversion towards reformation of man in the image of God, modern day constitutional institutions serve colonial constitutionalism and advance the cause of reformation of the native society in the image of the European civilisation, perhaps under the belief that the native society’s salvation lies in Westernisation.

political theology that is barely half a millennium old and whose approach to those outside its fold is one of ‘toleration’ until the Word of God pierces and saves the native soul. Further, indigenous beliefs are expected to pass muster on the evidentiary anvils inspired by two sources: the first is the Christian need for a written scripture or the indigenous equivalent of the Word of God, and the second is that indigenous practices, traditions and beliefs have had to satisfy the all-important condition precedent of ‘reason’, that is, secularised, Protestant OET.

To add to it, in order to demonstrate their ‘tolerance’ by virtue of being the ‘majority’, surviving indigenous global minorities are expected to remain mum about their histories. This is one of the lesser appreciated ramifications of modern constitutionalism, given its propensity to secularise history, which has a direct impact on education policy in general, and specifically on the shaping of curriculum.

What makes matters worse is the sense of religiosity with which constitutions are approached in former colonies, almost as if to prove with vengeance their modern, secular and liberal bona fides to their erstwhile colonial masters, and to earn their validation as ‘civilised nations of laws’. In short, the message that is being conveyed by the colonialised native is that ‘we are no less European/Western/modern/rational and therefore, your equals’ instead of saying ‘we do not wish to be European/Western, for we are comfortable in our skin and our subjectivities’.

This makes it detrimental to the indigenous worldview since the colonialised constitutional patriot has already bought into Eurocentrism/Western-normativism either consciously or otherwise, thereby turning into an ambassador and evangelist for the coloniality/modernity/rationality complex. That their identity as a member of the indigenous community has been weaponised to act against indigenous consciousness is lost in the incoherent and self-absorbed din of modernity, rationality and constitutional patriotism.

Therefore, the constitution—the supreme law, the fount of constitutional morality, the document which contains the original intent—must be the primary subject of decolonial scholarship and efforts in indigenous societies while they still have the power to restore their agency over their consciousness and accord indigeneity its rightful place. After all, if indigeneity has no respect in the land of its birth in the context of law and policymaking and is relegated to a mere ornamental talking point, it cannot hope to be taken seriously in a colonialised modern world.

Other scholars, such as Ramón Grosfoguel, also subscribe to this position because they believe that the non-West is responding to Eurocentrism with Eurocentric solutions; which explains the rise of European-style nationalism in former colonies instead of responses that are more rooted in their own cultures and civilisations.17 As opposed to questioning the European expectation and benchmark of ‘civilised nations’ using indigenous thought, former colonies seem more eager to join the club of civilised nation-states to prove that they are not ‘savages’ anymore.

at the heart of the transformation called for by decoloniality is the re-inscription of relationality into the indigenous approach to nature in order for indigeneity to take root, which is bound to have a direct bearing on all other aspects of life and civilisation.

The clearest proof, of course, is the fact that the ‘independent’ Indian State tests its standing on the global stage not on its ability to reclaim its consciousness and live by its own values, but on the basis of its position in the ‘global order’ (read the West) as a ‘civilised nation’.

The European worldview, which puts stock in the domination of ‘one nation’ or ‘one people’ over others at the expense of the identity of others or their very existence, naturally, cannot seem to fathom what keeps Bharat together despite its diversity.

That said, merely because Bharat is a living civilisation in the realm of society, it does not translate to Bharat being a civilisation-state. In other words, a State that presides over a civilisation is not a civilisation-state; instead, a State that is conscious of the civilisational character of its society and structures itself on civilisational lines is a civilisation-state.

First, when he calls Bharat more of a cultural possession than a material one, Mookerji strikes a clear distinction between the territorial nationalism of the European coloniser and the cultural veneration of the Indic native. It is this cultural veneration and a sense of relational custodianship, to put it in the language of decoloniality, as opposed to a sense of territorial ownership, that has made it possible for Bharat to be a melting pot of diverse sects that have coexisted within the Dharmic fold.

In fact, I would go to the extent of stating that since Bharat is the only natural homeland for the Indic consciousness, the Indian State has the civilisational duty to ensure that this space remains as such, and the accommodation of any other consciousness is contingent on (a) respect for the undeniable and inseparable relationship between Bharat and the Indic consciousness and (b) giving up those tenets that dehumanise the Indic consciousness or call for its extermination, whether scripturally sanctioned or not.

At least in the context of Bharat, the whole is as strong as its parts and the survival of the parts is contingent on the existence of the whole. Preserving this balance is easier said than done but as long as the State is committed to preserving this balance and is also seen as being committed to it, it would be keeping intact the civilisational, political and territorial integrity of Bharat by protecting it against centrifugal impulses, either homegrown or external.

The irony is that, as opposed to appreciating the value of such systems which were independent of the State, every such system (including civilisational nerve centres, such as places of worship) has been brought under the looming shadow of the State in ‘modern’ India. In the process, the Indic society has been left entirely dependent on the State for preservation of its core interests, while the State continues speeding down the path of greater colonialisation (not colonisation) while paying lip service to Bharat as a civilisational State.

European-style nation-state is built on the premise of a ‘nation’, that is, people bound by one or more factors, such as language, faith or ethnicity. Given the internal homogeneity of a European nation-state, it makes sense and is perhaps more desirable to treat the individual as the core unit whose rights must be safeguarded against intrusion by the State and other individuals.

That this is a question of survival, is certainly not a far-fetched or remotely alarmist position to take since the history of the last 1,300 years speaks volumes for those who are willing to listen and act with honesty and integrity. If this position invites criticisms of being illiberal, it only demonstrates that liberalism has been weaponised to further the ends of coloniality or it is fundamentally colonial, which is perhaps the case. In either case, it is detrimental to indigenous identities. Therefore, decoloniality must confront it head-on since the goals of decoloniality are far more important for indigenous consciousness and, dare I say, the entire world, than the goals of liberalism.

In a nutshell, there are typically only two acceptable choices for those who wish to understand Bharat’s history—they must either subscribe to that school of thought which denies Bharat’s antiquity, unity and Indic consciousness, or accept the view which recognises the validity of Bharat’s indigenous OET, with the caveat that ‘Hindu nationalism’ must be exorcised from the Indian mind.

Simply put, it is the expression of the decolonial urge of the silenced and long-silent native to reclaim and re-exist. When this expression is pejoratively and phobically caricatured as ‘Hindu nationalism’, the only logical inference that can be drawn is that every other culture and society has the right to exercise the decolonial option, except Bharat.

If Bharat’s native consciousness never gets to tell its story the way it has experienced it, not only will the world, including Bharatiyas, never know what Bharat has been subjected to, it will also amount to a monumental failure to memorialise its colonisation and colonialisation. This is the key to preventing similar or worse colonisation, whether ongoing or potential. After all, the survival of a consciousness is inextricably connected to its ability to remember the good, the bad and the ugly, and pass on that memory to future generations.

Therefore, decoloniality in Bharat’s context is not only an attempt to reclaim its fundamental right to agency to define itself but also includes the right to transmit its lived experience on its own terms and using its own lexicon, in order to stave off a worse fate, which is reflected by the constantly shrinking size of its sacred geography.

That the Company was the product of coloniality and the Christian consciousness of the British Crown was established in judicial proceedings in 1683, when it brought an action against another English trader, Thomas Sandys, for directly trading with India in violation of the exclusive rights granted to it by the Crown under the Charter.8 Among the reasons spelt out by the King’s Bench of the England and Wales Court for upholding the legal validity of the Company’s action against Sandys under the Charter, one was that the King, as a good Christian, ought to be and was deemed to be at war with ‘infidels’ forever, which applied equally to all his subjects. Therefore, as the defender of the Christian faith, it fell within the scope of his prerogative to relax this ‘normal rule’ for his subjects or a for a class of them if he so deemed fit, and only such beneficiaries of the relaxation would be allowed to trade with the ‘enemy’, that is, the infidel.9 It

The Company was seen for what it truly was or had become—an extension of British sovereignty in the East through delegation of powers reinforced by the nature of monopoly enjoyed by it under the Charter.

By 1813, in the East India Company Act of the same year, the Crown categorically spoke of its ‘undoubted sovereignty’ over the said territories and others.

Based on the provisions of the 1813 Act, it could be reasonably inferred that the intent of the Company as expressed in 1614 and 1659 to spread Christianity among the people of Bharat, had formally crystallised into the establishment of a Christian ecosystem in Bharat under the mandate of the Crown and the British Parliament.

persistent efforts of missionary groups for several years.18 The conviction with which the case for Christianity in Bharat was pitched is evident from the fact that proponents of missionary work genuinely believed that the improvement of the condition of the people of Bharat was intimately bound to one essential prerequisite—conversion to Christianity. The resistance of the Company to increased missionary activity in Bharat until the 1813 Act did not spring from the well of religious neutrality or ‘secularism’ as some would like to believe, but was merely the product of mercantile pragmatism.

The Company’s reluctance to institutionalise missionary activity was also partly owed to the experience of the Vellore Mutiny in 1806, which resulted in the death of 200 in a garrison of 370 due to a revolt of Indian soldiers against their officers.24 The revolt was triggered by apprehensions among the soldiers that the Company was intent on converting them to Christianity by force. Therefore, the Company had its own reasons for partially staving off missionary activity at the levels sought by pro-mission groups.

On the contrary, indigenous/Indic OET was restructured to fit into the Christian idea of ‘religion’, which was embraced, unfortunately, by Hindu ‘reform’ movements as well. This translated to a doctrinal and scriptural approach to ‘Hinduism’, that is, only those practices which could be traced to the sacred texts of Hinduism would be tolerated by the colonial State, while the rest would be treated as superstitious and immoral, warranting State interference. To support this, the coloniser drew from the Protestant/Lockean position that struck a distinction between ‘core’ religious practices that did not warrant State interference, and ‘false religion’ and civil/secular aspects of religious practices that permitted State intervention.

This is but one of the examples of the manner in which concepts, such as ‘secularism’ and ‘equality’, have played out in so-called independent, decolonised Bharat—to the extreme detriment of its indigenous consciousness. This is in stark contrast to the Christian secularism of Europe which protects Christian institutions from State interference. In other words, the coloniality of the Indian State is evidenced by the fact that as opposed to preserving and respecting the space of Indic consciousness, which would have been consistent with the policy of Christian toleration and secularism of the coloniser that accorded primacy to Christianity, the Indian State acts as the successor of the coloniser in its stepmotherly treatment of native consciousness.

As is evident, the above test was originally formulated to distinguish between the religious and the secular in the context of determining the scope of State powers to regulate the secular aspects of a religious institution under Article 25(2)(a). However, it would ultimately morph in subsequent judgments of the Supreme Court into a test to determine the ‘essential aspects’ of a religion for the very purpose of the enjoyment of fundamental religious freedoms under Article 25(1).

A reading of the said judgments reveals that, surprisingly, the position of the Supreme Court is largely consistent with the decolonial position that Indic faith systems are distinct from both Abrahamic religions, and yet qualify for protection under the constitution as ‘the Hindu religion’. In other words, the Supreme Court, while recognising that Sanatana Dharma cannot be understood through the Abrahamic construct of ‘religion’, has not taken away the right of Dharmic OET systems to be treated as ‘religion’ for the purposes of enjoyment and exercise of constitutionally guaranteed fundamental freedoms.

While both believe in the concept of ‘false religion’ in the context of native societies which do not share their faith, the former destroys ‘false religions’ root and branch through overt subjugation, while the latter attempts to convert, failing which, it subtly moulds and reconstructs other faith systems in its own image by applying its framework to bring them in line with Christian consciousness. The former’s direct and visible aggression invited fierce resistance from Indic consciousness, while the latter’s attempt to Christianise it through its policy of toleration and secularism resulted in the integration of the native Indic consciousness in a Eurocentric ‘modern’ global order.

One of the reasons that this letter is educative is that it informs us that at least until 1823, indigenous consciousness and epistemology had survived 12 centuries of genocidal campaigns by Middle Eastern coloniality. In stark contrast, in less than two centuries, European coloniality has made deep inroads which Middle Eastern coloniality could not. The

We were filled with sanguine hopes that this sum would be laid out in employing European Gentlemen of talents and education to instruct the natives of India in Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Anatomy and other useful Sciences, which the Nations of Europe have carried to a degree of perfection that has raised them above the inhabitants of other parts of the world.

Dr. Balagangadhara observed on the role of the coloniser and the colonised in creating and perpetuating coloniality, it could be said that Roy’s letter is a textbook example of the role of the colonised. Therefore, in adopting a decolonial approach, as much as it is important to identify the role of the coloniser in altering the state of affairs as it existed prior to his arrival, it is equally important to acknowledge the role of the colonised in aiding the spread and entrenchment of the coloniser’s colonial consciousness, especially after having achieved decolonisation or ‘independence’.

It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the Sanscrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgments used at preparatory schools in England. In every branch of physical or moral philosophy, the relative position of the two nations is nearly the same.

[18] I can by no means admit that, when a nation of high intellectual attainments undertakes to superintend the education of a nation comparatively ignorant, the learners are absolutely to prescribe the course which is to be taken by the teachers. It is not necessary however to say anything on this subject. For it is proved by unanswerable evidence, that we are not at present securing the co-operation of the natives. It would be bad enough to consult their intellectual taste at the expense of their intellectual health. But we are consulting neither. We are withholding from them the learning which is palatable to them. We are forcing on them the mock learning which they nauseate.

We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern,—a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population.

The long and short of the preceding discussion on religion, caste, tribe and education, based on primary sources as well as scholarly literature, is that at least until 1853, the intention of the Christian European coloniser was to establish a politico-legal and social infrastructure which aided the spread of Christian colonial consciousness in every aspect of the native society.

Therefore, I would not draw too much comfort from a mere paper identity when the native Indic consciousness is buried under layers of colonial consciousness without even realising it. As stated earlier, the decolonial ‘option’ is not just an option but an existential imperative for Indic civilisational consciousness; and since the Constitution is being pushed as a ‘secular’ document without examining it for colonial consciousness, a decolonial evaluation of the document and its antecedents is an exercise that must be undertaken without any further protraction.

As I listened to their lengthy objections, it became clear to me that the features the engineers wanted to add all came from Loudcloud requirements. As painful as it might be, I knew that we had to get into the broader market in order to understand it well enough to build the right product.

It turns out that is exactly what product strategy is all about—figuring out the right product is the innovator’s job, not the customer’s job. The customer only knows what she thinks she wants based on her experience with the current product. The innovator can take into account everything that’s possible, but often must go against what she knows to be true. As a result, innovation requires a combination of knowledge, skill, and courage. Sometimes only the founder has the courage to ignore the data; we were running out of time, so I had to step in:

I never built that contingency plan. Through the seemingly impossible Loudcloud series C and IPO processes, I learned one important lesson: Startup CEOs should not play the odds.

The clearest sign of the terminal decline of the Mughal empire was its Balkanisation through the establishment of the Asaf Jahi dynasty in the Deccan (also known as the Nizam ul-Mulk of Hyderabad) in 1713, the Awadh dynasty under Nawab Sadat Ali Khan (Burhan ul-Mulk) in 1723 and the Bengal dynasty under Nawab Aliwardi Khan in 1740.1 To add to it, Nadir Shah’s sack of Delhi in 1739 had rendered the Mughal empire hollow and exposed its own decrepitude.

My old boss Jim Barksdale was fond of saying, “We take care of the people, the products, and the profits—in that order.” It’s a simple saying, but it’s deep. “Taking care of the people” is the most difficult of the three by far and if you don’t do it, the other two won’t matter. Taking care of the people means that your company is a good place to work.

“Let me break it down for you. In good organizations, people can focus on their work and have confidence that if they get their work done, good things will happen for both the company and them personally. It is a true pleasure to work in an organization such as this. Every person can wake up knowing that the work they do will be efficient, effective, and make a difference for the organization and themselves. These things make their jobs both motivating and fulfilling.

Good product managers know the market, the product, the product line, and the competition extremely well and operate from a strong basis of knowledge and confidence. A good product manager is the CEO of the product. Good product managers take full responsibility and measure themselves in terms of the success of the product. They are responsible for right product/right time and all that entails. A good product manager knows the context going in (the company, our revenue funding, competition, etc.), and they take responsibility for devising and executing a winning plan (no excuses).

If you know a great head of sales, interview them first and learn what they think made them great. Figure out which of those strengths most directly match the needs of your company. If possible, include the domain expert in the interview process. However, be aware that the domain expert only has part of the knowledge necessary to make the hire. Specifically, she has very little knowledge of your company, how it works, and what its needs are. Therefore, you cannot defer the decision to the domain expert.

By managing the organization as though it were a black box, some divisions at HP optimized the present at the expense of their downstream competitiveness. The company rewarded managers for achieving short-term objectives in a manner that was bad for the company. It would have been better to take into account the white box. The white box goes beyond the numbers and gets into how the organization produced the numbers. It penalizes managers who sacrifice the future for the short term and rewards those who invest in the future even if that investment cannot be easily measured.

It is easy to see that there are many ways for leaders to be misinterpreted. To get things right, you must recognize that anything you measure automatically creates a set of employee behaviors. Once you determine the result you want, you need to test the description of the result against the employee behaviors that the description will likely create. Otherwise, the side-effect behaviors may be worse than the situation you were trying to fix.

If faced with giving everyone the same bonus to make things easy or with sharply rewarding performance and ruffling many feathers, they’ll ruffle the feathers. If given the choice of cutting a popular project today, because it’s not in the long-term plans or you’re keeping it around for morale purposes and to appear consistent, they’ll cut it today. Why?

As a company grows, it will change. No matter how well you set your culture, keep your spirit, or slow-roll your growth, your company won’t be the same when it’s one thousand people as it was when it was ten people. But that doesn’t mean that it can’t be a good company when it reaches 1,000, 10,000, or even 100,000 employees. It will just be different. Making it good at scale means admitting that it must be different and embracing the changes that you’ll need to make to keep things from falling apart.

On the other hand, people who view the world purely through the team prism will very seldom use the words I or me even when answering questions about their accomplishments. Even in an interview, they will deflect credit to others on their previous team. They will tend to be far more interested in how your company will win than in how they will be compensated or what their career path will be. When asked about a previously failed company, they will generally feel such great responsibility that they will describe in detail their own misjudgments and bad decisions.

The opposite is true. Without a well thought out, disciplined process for titles and promotions, your employees will become obsessed with the resulting inequities. If you structure things properly, nobody other than you will spend much time thinking about titles other than Employee of the Month. WHEN SMART PEOPLE ARE BAD EMPLOYEES In business, intelligence is always a critical element in any employee, because what we do is difficult and complex and the competitors are filled with extremely smart people. However, intelligence is not the only important quality. Being effective in a company also means working hard, being reliable, and being an excellent member of the team. When I was a CEO, this was one of the most difficult lessons for me to learn. I felt that it was my job to create an environment where brilliant people of all backgrounds, personality types, and work styles would thrive. And I was right. That was my job. Companies where people with diverse backgrounds and work styles can succeed have significant advantages in recruiting and retaining top talent over those that don’t. Still, you can take it too far. And I did. Here are three examples of the smartest people in the company being the worst employees. EXAMPLE 1: THE HERETIC Any sizable company produces some number of strategies, projects, processes, promotions, and other activities that don’t make sense. No large organization achieves perfection. As a result, a company needs lots of smart, super-engaged employees who can identify its particular weaknesses and help it improve them. However, sometimes a really smart employee develops an agenda other than improving the company. Rather than identifying weaknesses so that he can fix them, he looks for faults to build his case. Specifically, he builds his case that the company is hopeless and run by a bunch of morons. The smarter the employee, the more destructive this type of behavior can be. Simply put, it takes a really smart person to be maximally destructive, because otherwise nobody else will listen to him. Why would a smart person try to destroy the company that he works for? There are actually many reasons. Here are a few: 1. She is disempowered. She feels that she cannot access the people in charge and, as a result, complaining is her only vehicle to get the truth out. 2. She is fundamentally a rebel. She will not be happy unless she is rebelling; this can be a deep personality trait. Sometimes

One good test for determining whether to go with outside experience versus internal promotion is to figure out whether you value inside knowledge or outside knowledge more for the position. For example, for engineering managers the comprehensive knowledge of the code base and engineering team is usually more important and difficult to acquire than knowledge of how to run scalable engineering organizations. As a result, you might very well value the knowledge of your own organization more than that of the outside world.

Management Even if an executive does a superb job achieving her goals, that doesn’t mean she is building a strong and loyal team. It’s important to understand how well she is managing, even if she is hitting her goals. 3. Innovation It’s quite possible for an executive to hit her goal for the quarter by ignoring the future. For example, a great way for an engineering manager to hit her goals for features and dates is by building a horrible architecture, which won’t even support the next release. This is why you must look beyond the black-box results and into the sausage factory to see how things get made. 4.

Focus on where you are going rather than on what you hope to avoid.

Great CEOs face the pain. They deal with the sleepless nights, the cold sweats, and what my friend the great Alfred Chuang (legendary cofounder and CEO of BEA Systems) calls “the torture.” Whenever I meet a successful CEO, I ask them how they did it. Mediocre CEOs point to their brilliant strategic moves or their intuitive business sense or a variety of other self-congratulatory explanations. The great CEOs tend to be remarkably consistent in their answers. They all say, “I didn’t quit.”

SO, ARE GREAT LEADERS BORN OR MADE? Let’s look at this one attribute at a time:   Articulating the vision There is no question that some people are much better storytellers than others. However, it is also true that anybody can greatly improve in this area through focus and hard work. All CEOs should work on the vision component of leadership.   Alignment of interests I am not sure if the Bill Campbell attribute is impossible to learn, but I am pretty sure that it is impossible to teach. Of the three, this one most fits the bill “born not made.”   Ability to achieve the vision This attribute can absolutely be learned; perhaps this is why Andy Grove’s tolerance for incompetence was legendarily low. Indeed, the enemy of competence is sometimes confidence. A CEO should never be so confident that she stops improving her skills.

The basic idea is that people open up to feedback far more if you start by complimenting them (slice of bread number one), then you give them the difficult message (the shit), then wrap up by reminding them how much you value their strengths (slice of bread number two). The shit sandwich also has the positive side effect of focusing the feedback on the behavior rather than the person, because you establish up front that you really value the person. This is a key concept in giving feedback.

This means that what passes off as syncretism was and remains significantly the product of a nouveau convert unable to let go of his Hindu roots, which cannot be construed as Islam having acquired a distinct Bharatiya flavour or as revealing its malleability upon contact with Bharat.

Therefore, according to Prasad, the British government conveniently looked the other way until the Wahhabi problem became its own problem, and then suddenly ‘discovered’ the existence of the network.

Therefore, reformist movements, whether in Christianity or Islam, did not mellow their antipathy for idol-worshipping or nature-worshipping indigenous communities. On the contrary, reform translated to calls for greater ‘purity’ and greater Christian (European/Western)/Islamic (Middle Eastern) consciousness, which inevitably translated to purer and more determined hatred, with scriptural and clerical sanction, for those outside the fold.

Additionally, since it contributed to the creation of Pakistan through Syed Ahmed Khan’s exposition of the Two-Nation Theory, to say that Dehlawi’s goal was achieved, at least in part, would not be incorrect, since according to Dehlawi the whole of the Bharatiya subcontinent belonged to Islam.

It was between 1857 and 1870 that Khan’s role as the ‘modern’ defender of Islam was shaped better, which manifested broadly in three ways—defence of the Muslim community; defence of Islam; and the mainstreaming of English/Western education in the Muslim community through an Anglo-Islamic model.

Importantly, even Syed Ahmed Khan did not refute the fact that calls for jihad were indeed issued at the time—his sole disagreement was that the calls were without Islamic basis, and hence invalid. He argued against the use of jihad under colonial rule, but not against jihad itself, since according to him, Muslims of the subcontinent had no right to wage war against the British as long as their religious freedoms were not interfered with.

The reason that the British establishment viewed Khan’s initiatives and the Aligarh College with favour was that it was keen on countering the growing political awareness of the Hindus who, as stated earlier, had been exposed to English education for at least five decades since its introduction in 1817, i.e., even before Macaulay’s Education Policy of 1835. According to R.C. Majumdar:54

The objective of the Congress is to transfer the political control of the country from the British to the Hindus. It demands the repeal of the Arms Act, reduction of military expenditure, and the consequential weakening of the frontier defences. Musalmans can have no sympathy with these demands. It is imperative for the Muslims and the British to unite with a view to fighting these agitators and prevent the introduction of democratic form of government, unsuited as it is to the needs and genius of the country. We therefore, advocate loyalty to the Government and Anglo-Muslim collaboration.

Critically, Khan was clear that the purpose of the college was not to merely churn out loyal and competent employees for the British establishment but also to provide a space for Muslim solidarity and regeneration, with its graduates serving as ‘modern’ ambassadors of the cause. In 1876, Khan told his students:59 There is no god but Allah, this is the cornerstone of our faith, and only by believing in it we are a nation. If you excel in other fields but do not believe in it, then we shall cease to be a nation. We would have nothing to do with you,

To make matters worse, in a speech delivered in Lucknow in 1887, Syed Ahmed Khan dismissed the idea of the ‘lower classes’ climbing up the ladder to rule over the ‘nobility’.62 So much for Islamic egalitarianism and brotherhood.

object of founding such institutions was uplift of a particular community and restoration of its former status as ‘rulers of Hindustan’, the blame must be laid at the door of those Hindus who wallowed in notions of unity—to such an extent that they were open to their children being educated in such institutions.

The second key principle of anthropology is that listening to someone else’s view, however “strange,” does not just teach empathy for others, which is badly needed today; it also makes it easier to see yourself.

Anthropology is about interpretation and sense-making; it typically looks at the micro-level and tries to draw big conclusions. But since humans are not like chemicals in a test tube, or even data in an AI program, this deep, open-ended observation and interpretation can be valuable; particularly if we keep an open mind about what we might find.IV

Many Americans assumed that Chinese consumers must secretly hate the idea of this surveillance, since the Americans did. The Intel team argued, however, that it was a mistake to presume that the Chinese must view things as Americans did. They did not pretend to fully understand what was happening in the minds and lives of the Chinese people they were studying: their studies were “shallow” by academic standards (of a relatively short duration), the team relied on translators (since Anderson did not speak Chinese), and they knew they were operating in a country with government controls.

Oakes thought this was ridiculous, since these digital traces were often poor quality. In any case, he doubted whether fragmented pieces of individual digital activity were a good guide to cultural patterns; instead, he believed—like most anthropologists—that behavior was shaped by group sentiment as well, which could not be tracked by fragmented, individual data points.
